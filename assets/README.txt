# Universal Paperclips!

This is an Electron port of https://github.com/stignarnia/UniversalPaperclipsButSaves, which is itself an offline port 
of the original game by Frank Lantz here > https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index.html.

IMPORTANT: For now, you will have to click "SAVE SLOT 1" or "SAVE SLOT 2" and 
"LOAD SLOT 1" or "LOAD SLOT 2" before closing and after launching to save/restore progress.

Eventually I would like to add an auto-save feature.
